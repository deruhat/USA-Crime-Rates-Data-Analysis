# USA-Crime-Rates-Data-Analysis
In our project, we have a data set that contains more than 8,500 cities in the United States with the number of crimes that happened in each city in 2016. It is detailed and contains the number of violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault) and property crimes (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, arson) during 2016. We want to explore the relationship between populations and different types of crimes, as well as determining the safest and most dangerous states and cities within each population range. We also plan to observe and visualize patterns related to violent crimes compared to property crimes in cities with relatively similar populations.
